# COVID-19

As COVID-19 became a globally pandemic, fear spreads rampantly accross the world. Much has yet to be discovered about COVID-19. This exercise serves to find correlations between the spread and mortality rate of COVID-19, and difference factors in OECD countries. Hopefully we can gain some insight as to where investments should be directed towards in order to contain/slow the spread of future epidemics.
These factors are: 
- Health 
- Income distribution 
- GDP 
- Labor market 
Beside finding correlations between COVID-19 spread and morality rates and these factors, the secondary objective is to analyze whether implementing strict lockdown policies have an impact on the spread and mortality rate of COVID-19. 

The data used in this analysis comes from ECDC and OECD.Stat
